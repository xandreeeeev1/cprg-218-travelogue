            <p>I had this memory when I visit this place wherein, We had a hard time exploring the place because of the weather, It's a little bit gloomy when we explore the Emerald River. The Scenery was like a painting in person, It feels like you're inside a Painting. It's so chill when I take this picture, I only heard the sound of the nature, birds and the wind.</p>
